        "# Theory Questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented programming?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of &quot;objects,&quot;\n",
        " which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOPS?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Python, a class is like a blueprint or a template for creating objects. A class defines the structure and behavior that objects created from it will have. It provides a way to structure our code by grouping related data (attributes) and behavior (methods)into reusable units (objects). They are essential for modeling real-world entities and creating complex software systems.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a specific instance of a class. Think of a class as a blueprint or template, and an object as a concrete thing built from that blueprint. An object is created from a class. The class defines the general structure and behavior, while the object represents a particular thing with its own specific data. In essence, objects are the core components of an object-oriented program. They allow you to represent real-world entities and their interactions in a structured and organized way.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- Abstraction and encapsulation are both fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, but they differ in purpose. Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object, allowing the user to interact with it without needing to understand its inner workings. It focuses on what an object does. On the other hand, encapsulation involves bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components, typically through private attributes and public methods. It focuses on how data is protected and accessed. In essence, abstraction hides complexity, while encapsulation protects data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\" methods) in Python are special methods that have double underscores before and after their name, such as __init__, __str__, and __add__. These methods are used to implement basic operations or customize behavior for objects in a class. For example, __init__ is called when an object is created, __str__ defines how an object is represented as a string, and __add__ allows you to define custom behavior for the + operator. Dunder methods allow you to make your class behave like built-in types by defining how they should interact with common operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPS.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows us to create new classes (called derived classes or subclasses) based on existing classes (called base classes or superclasses). Think of it like a family tree: the derived class inherits characteristics and behaviors from its parent (the base class), but can also have its own unique traits.\n",
        " Inheritance is a powerful tool in OOP that helps you create well-structured, maintainable, and extensible code. It&#39;s a key concept for building complex software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Polymorphism, meaning &quot;many forms,&quot; is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific ways.\n",
        " Key Benefits of Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        " i) Code Reusability: You can write code that works with objects of different classes without having to write separate code for each class.\n",
        "\n",
        " ii) Flexibility: It makes your code more adaptable to changes. You can add new classes without affecting existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        " iii)  Maintainability: Polymorphism can make your code easier to maintain because changes to one class are less likely to affect other parts of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        " Polymorphism is a powerful tool that allows you to write more flexible, reusable, and maintainable code in object-oriented programming. It&#39;s a key concept for designing robust and extensible software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting access to an object's internal state and protecting its data through the use of private or protected attributes and methods. This is done by prefixing variables and methods with a double underscore (e.g., __variable), making them private and preventing direct access from outside the class. To interact with private attributes, public methods like getters and setters are provided. This ensures that the internal implementation details are hidden, promoting data integrity and controlling how data is accessed or modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: In Python, a constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically called when you create a new object (instance) of that class. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object&#39;s attributes (data). The constructor&#39;s name is always __init__ (double underscores on either side).\n",
        " Key Points about Constructors:\n",
        "\n",
        " i) They are automatically called during object creation.\n",
        "\n",
        " ii) They initialize the object&#39;s attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        " iii)  They use the self parameter to refer to the current object.\n",
        "\n",
        " iv)They are essential for setting up the initial state of an object.\n",
        "The constructor is a fundamental part of object-oriented programming in Python. It ensures that objects are properly initialized when they are created, making your code more robust and predictable.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: In Python, class methods and static methods are two types of methods that are defined within a class but behave differently.\n",
        "\n",
        " Class Method: A class method is bound to the class and not the instance. It takes a reference to the class (cls) as its first parameter, rather than a reference to the instance (self). Class methods are used for operations that are related to the class, rather than an instance of the class. They are defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        " Static Method: A static method, unlike the class method, does not take a reference to the instance or class as its first parameter. It behaves like a regular function but resides within the class's namespace. Static methods are defined using the @staticmethod decorator and are used when the method does not need to access or modify class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Method overloading is a feature in some object-oriented programming languages that allows you\n",
        "to define multiple methods within a class that have the same name but different parameters (either in number or type). When you call the method, the compiler or interpreter determines which version of the method to execute based on the arguments you provide. Python, due to its dynamic typing, does not directly support method overloading in the same way as\n",
        "languages like Java or C++. If you define two methods with the same name in a Python class, the second\n",
        "definition will simply override the first one.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOPS?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Method overriding is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that occurs when a derived class (subclass) provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its base class (superclass). It allows a subclass to customize or extend the behavior inherited from its superclass.\n",
        " Method overriding is a powerful tool in OOP that enables you to create flexible and extensible class hierarchies. It&#39;s a key concept for building complex software systems where you need to model different types of objects with varying behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: The @property decorator in Python is a built-in function that allows you to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes. It&#39;s a way to create &quot;managed attributes&quot; or &quot;computed properties.&quot; Think of it as a way to add getters, setters, and deleters to your class attributes, but with a cleaner syntax. Key Benefits of @property:\n",
        "\n",
        " i) Controlled Access: You can control how attributes are accessed and modified.\n",
        "\n",
        " ii) Data Validation: You can add validation logic to ensure data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        " iii) Computed Properties: You can create properties that are calculated dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        " iv) Cleaner Syntax: It provides a more Pythonic way to work with managed attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        " The @property decorator is a powerful tool for creating well-designed classes in Python. It helps you encapsulate data, control access, and make your code more readable and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOPS?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- Polymorphism is important in OOP because it enhances code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability. It allows different classes to use the same interface, making code simpler and more scalable. It supports encapsulation and abstraction, reduces dependency between components (loose coupling), and makes it easier to extend and modify systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- An abstract class in Python is a blueprint for other classes and cannot be instantiated. It is defined using the ABC module and contains at least one @abstractmethod, which must be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- Advantages of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "  i. Encapsulation – Protects data by restricting direct access.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ii. Reusability – Code can be reused using inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  iii. Polymorphism – Allows flexibility with a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "  iv. Abstraction – Hides complex implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "  v. Modularity – Organizes code into objects for better structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "  vi. Scalability & Maintainability – Easier to extend and update.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans-  A class variable is shared across all instances of a class, while an instance variable is unique to each instance. Class variables are defined inside the class but outside methods, whereas instance variables are defined within methods using self. Class variables have a common value for all objects unless explicitly changed, whereas instance variables store data specific to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans-  Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. This enables a child class to access attributes and methods from multiple base classes. It helps in code reusability but can lead to complexity, especially with the diamond problem (resolved using the Method Resolution Order - MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- The __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python serve different purposes for representing an object as a string:\n",
        "\n",
        " __str__: Used for a human-readable string representation of an object. It is called by print() and str().\n",
        "\n",
        " __repr__: Used for a developer-friendly or official string representation. It is called by repr() and aims to provide a more precise, unambiguous string that can ideally recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class in a child class. It helps in accessing inherited methods that have been overridden in the subclass, allowing for better method resolution and supporting multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        " Significance:\n",
        "\n",
        " i) Access Parent Class Methods – Calls a method from the parent class without explicitly naming it.\n",
        "\n",
        " ii) Avoids Redundant Code – Promotes reusability by using the parent class’s method.\n",
        "\n",
        " iii) Supports Multiple Inheritance – Helps in method resolution when multiple inheritance is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. It allows for cleanup operations like releasing resources (e.g., closing files or network connections) before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        " Significance:\n",
        "\n",
        " i) Resource Cleanup – Used to free resources held by the object.\n",
        "\n",
        " ii) Automatic Cleanup – Called automatically when an object is deleted or goes out of scope.\n",
        "\n",
        " iii) Garbage Collection – Helps in cases where explicit deletion or resource deallocation is needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- The difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod lies in how they interact with the class. The @staticmethod does not take the instance (self) or the class (cls) as the first argument, making it independent of both. It is used when the method doesn't need access to the class or instance, and it can be called on either the class or an instance. On the other hand, the @classmethod takes the class (cls) as its first argument, allowing it to modify class-level variables or call other class methods. It is used when the method requires access to the class itself. For example, Example.static_method() and Example.class_method() can be called on the class directly, but static_method doesn't interact with the class or instance, while class_method can access class attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans- In Python, polymorphism allows different classes to define methods with the same name, but each method can behave differently depending on the class. When polymorphism works with inheritance, a subclass can override a method from the parent class, and the correct method is called based on the object's class, not the reference type.\n",
        "\n",
        "  How it works:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  i) Method Overriding: A subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ii) Dynamic Method Resolution: Python calls the method of the subclass even if the reference is of the parent class type (thanks to dynamic typing).\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOPS?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- Method chaining in Python is the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single statement. This is possible when each method returns the object itself (self), allowing the next method to be called on the same instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans- The __call__ method in Python allows an object to be called like a function. It is used to define behavior for when an instance of a class is called directly, enabling objects to be used as callable entities. It has two purpose-\n",
        "  \n",
        "  i) Allows objects to behave like functions.\n",
        "\n",
        " ii) Enables dynamic behavior and flexibility in the code.\n"
